# PhysEngine

This rudimentary physics simulation engine is designed to cooperate with my other
repository [`RendEngine`](https://github.com/ArvinSKushwaha/RendEngine) (which doesn't exist yet). Together,
these libraries allow for complex physics simulation and physically-based rendering
of both audio and video.
