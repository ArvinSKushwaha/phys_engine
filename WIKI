#PhysEngine Wiki

This document describes the functionality of the `PhysEngine` library and how it works in conjunction with `RendEngine`. `PhysEngine` describes its entities with the `Entity` trait. All entities can have physical properties bound to them, which all implement `PhysicalProperty` trait.

## Constructing Entities

Below is an example of constructing an entity by loading a `.obj` file:

```rust
let mesh = PolyMesh::load_obj("octahedron.obj"); TODO
```

As you can see, the usage of entity constructors is fairly simple. The entity constructors are as follows (refer to the method documentation for more information.):

- `PolyMesh::load_obj(file_name: &str)` TODO
- `PolyMesh::from_vertex_face(vertices: &[Point3], edges: &[(usize, usize)])`
- `DiscMesh::from_poly_mesh(poly_mesh: &PolyMesh, config: DiscConfig)` TODO
